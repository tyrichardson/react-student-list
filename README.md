# React GitHub Student List

Before you get started make sure to look through the code that has been provided. Server side code to `GET` and `POST` a GitHub user has been provided for you. There is also a form in a **component** (`components/StudentForm/StudentForm.js`) that passes data entered by the user back to `App.js`. You should not need to modify the StudentForm **component**.

### Setup

Start mongo if you haven't already with `mongod`. Running the server code requires `nodemon`. If you don't already have `nodemon`, install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```

Between the server, client and mongo, you'll need three terminal tabs! Because we're using `nodemon` and `create-react-app`, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made!

> Note: You may also start mongo with `brew services start mongodb`, in that case, you will only need two terminal tabs.

## BASE MODE

- Use `axios` to submit and save form data to the database by posting data to `/students`.
- Retrieve the user list and store it in the `App.js`. Create a new **component** called `StudentList.js` and pass it the data. 
- Display the students in a table on the DOM.
- Update the user list each time a new user is added to the database.

## HARD MODE

- Add a **More Details** button for each user. When the button is clicked on, pass the selected user back to `App.js`.
- Make a request to the GitHub API to retrieve more details about the user. Create a new **component** on the page that displays those details.
   - `https://api.github.com/users/GITHUB_USERNAME?access_token=913f20e25e454b699cbf7b4d5f3ae7fd516cafc4`
- Create a new **component** that renders each individual list item in the user list.

### GitHub Rate Limit

GitHub doesn't like it when malicious users pummel their API with an absurd ammount of requests. Unfortunately, there's not a great way to tell who is malicious and who is not, so there is a rate limit to the number of requests allowed by GitHub (50 per hour from an IP address). You can increase that limit with a GitHub access token (pretty common among APIs). If you begin to get `403` status errors, you may want to try using our access token which will bump you up to 5000 requests per hour:

```
https://api.github.com/users/GITHUB_USERNAME?access_token=913f20e25e454b699cbf7b4d5f3ae7fd516cafc4
```

If your cohort burns through that, try creating your own access token:

### Hard Mode Wireframe

## PRO MODE

- Add a button to **delete** a user from the list. This will require both UI changes and a new route.
- It's pretty weird that details and a broken image are showing up right away because we don't have a default user. Use [react conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) to only show the details section if there is a selected user.
- Add styling to your components.
- Repeat over the users followers and display them below the selected users profile information.

No wireframe for pro mode.
